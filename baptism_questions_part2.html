                        Christians should obey governmental requirements, including legal marriage. Being legally married shows respect for authority and protects both partners legally and socially. It demonstrates that we honor both God's arrangement and human law.

                        Marriage should be held in honor and kept pure. Legal marriage protects the honor of the marriage arrangement and ensures that the intimate relationship is within God's approved bounds. It also provides legal protection and recognition for both spouses.
